My 2019 Honda CB650R is approaching 25.000 kilometres so it was time for a regular service. It is almost 2 years old and with that warranty period is about to end. No reason anymore to perform service at a dealer and pay a hefty premium. Simple service is about ~100 euros in my parts so I figured I can do it myself and save some money.

### Items needed

- 2.7 litres of oil
- oil filter
- oil drain plug washer
- brake fluid (maybe)

#### Oil

Manual calls for 10w-30 and I see no reason to deviate from this. It also needs to satisfy `JASO MA2` specification. This is important since the same oil lubricates engine and transmission. I found [Eneos Max Performance 10w-30](https://eneoseurope.com/products/eneos-max-performance-10w-30/) motorbike oil for a _great_ price around 5 euros per litre.

#### Oil filter

Search result for this specific bike are scarce but forums says that filter is the same dimensions as previous version of the bike CB650F. Which makes sense since engine received only minimal updates between versions. [Mann 64/1](https://catalog.mann-filter.com/EU/eng/catalog/MANN-FILTER%20Katalog%20Europa/Oil%20Filter/MW%2064~1) fits okay as should other filters compatible with CB650F.

### Procedure

Warm up the oil by taking a short ride. Open the oil filler cap, unscrew the drain bolt and try not to make a mess. After oil is mostly drained unscrew the oil filter and try even harder to prevent oil from spilling everywhere. Special tools for unscrewing oil filters are recommended but you can also poke a hole through the filter with a screwdriver or a sturdy knife to get leverage. Screw in the fresh filter. Hand tight is good enough but use some muscle. Screw in the drain plug and replace the washer. Inner diameter of washer must be 12 millimetres and have around 3-4 millimetres of ring thickness. You can also reuse the washer if it's not crushed too bad.

After you plug in the holes it's time to pour around 2.5 litres of oil in and check the oil level. Manual says oil level is checked on flat ground, motorcycle straight up and dipstick _not_ screwed in. It is possible that oil level will show higher than it is because of the air pockets forming inside the engine. It is good idea to start the engine for oil to cycle through and then wait a few minutes and check the level again.

And with that oil change is done. It is good idea to check other things like tyres, brakes, chain and such. In my case there was some brake fluid missing in the front reservoir caused by brake pads wear. Just top it off with `DOT4` brake fluid. You want to buy it in small quantities since it goes bad after a few years and you need it only a small amount (1 litre is already too much).

All in all not hard to do and it saved me around 70 euros. I also like doing such things. Working on your motorcycle bonds you to the machine in a similar way than going on a long trip with it.

Have fun and ride safe.
